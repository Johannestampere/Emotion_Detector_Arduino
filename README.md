# LED Emotion Indicator

This project uses a camera to detect human emotions and activates a corresponding LED based on the detected expression. The system maps detected emotions (such as happiness, sadness, anger, etc.) to specific LED colors, providing a real-time, visual representation of the user’s mood.

## Technologies Used

- **Python** – Main programming language
- **OpenCV** – Real-time facial detection
- **TensorFlow** – Emotion recognition using a pre-trained model (Kaggle dataset)
- **NumPy** – Data handling and processing
- **PySerial** – Communication between Python and Arduino
- **Arduino** – Microcontroller for controlling LEDs
